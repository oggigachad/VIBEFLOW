Hey
Havana, ooh-na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na, ah
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (ay)
There's somethin' 'bout his manners (uh-huh), Havana, ooh-na-na (uh)
He didn't walk up with that, "How you doin'?" (Uh)
When he came in the room
He said there's a lotta girls I can do with (uh)
But I can't without you
I knew him forever in a minute (hey)
That summer night in June
And papa says he got malo in him (uh)
He got me feelin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh" (ay)
I knew it when I met him (ay), I loved him when I left him
Got me feelin' like, "Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh"
And then I had to tell him, I had to go
Oh, na-na-na-na-na (whoo)
Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay, uh-huh)
He took me back to East Atlanta, na-na-na
Oh, but my heart is in Havana (huh)
My heart is in Havana (hey), Havana, ooh-na-na
